<h2>Goose Script</h2>
<h3>I use this little script to install (and prank) my classmates with an application called "Desktop Goose". This script installs it on other machines and executes it five times. </h3>
<h2>United Zip</h2>
<h3>The main objective in this script was to build a united zipping and unzipping tool that has all the following compressing programs in it: gzip, zip, bzip2 and xz.</h3>
<h3>Follow these steps to use this tool:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1. Open a Shell</li>
  <li>2. Download the script with: "wget https://github.com/AndrasTarlos/Projects/blob/main/Bash/Unitzip/unitzip.sh"</li>
  <li>3. If the script doesn't have 'x' (execute) permissions, type: chmod 777 unitzip.sh</li>
  <li>4. Type: "./unitzip.sh --help" for help</li>
</ul>
